# Woo Document Analysis

This repository contains code for the analysis of documents related to the Open Government Act.

The Open Government Act (Wet open Overheid, WOO) requires govermental organizations to actively dislose information.
Documents published by the City of Amsterdam can currently be found on 
[https://open.amsterdam/](https://open.amsterdam/),
[https://amsterdam.raadsinformatie.nl/](https://amsterdam.raadsinformatie.nl/)
and [https://openresearch.amsterdam/](https://openresearch.amsterdam/).

We investigate recent technological advances such as the use of Large Language Models to improve the searchability and accessbility of these documents.
